"""Thin entry point for the LMStudioClaw controller.

Starts the resident controller: finds a free web port (with fallback if the preferred
one is taken — FR-055), serves the FastAPI app via uvicorn on a **background thread**,
and runs the system-tray icon on the **main thread** (the reliable pystray pattern on
Windows; works under ``pythonw`` with no console). The tray auto-opens the browser
control panel on launch; its "Quit" item stops the server and the tray, ending the
process (FR-043). Closing the browser does not quit the app.

Any startup failure is written to ``%APPDATA%/LMStudioClaw/startup.log`` so silent
``pythonw`` crashes (no console to print to) are diagnosable.
